## Blackout
Blackout is a tactical FPS on Roblox, similar to [Rainbow 6: Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege).<br>
We are far from done with this game currently, but you can view our progress on our [Blackout Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/L8wlMW8e/ATTI6c0361c9ab6a36f3dd8669837e0cc9fe14DF01D7/blackout-game).<br>
The game will feature realistic shooting mechanics, (hopefully) similar destruction physics to Rainbow 6, and slow-paced tactical gameplay.
